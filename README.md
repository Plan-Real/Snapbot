## Abstract
In the modern world, the creation of personal digital images has become increasingly important with the rapid development of social media platforms. Photography, especially selfies, is at the center of this shift. A great selfie can strengthen a person's digital identity and increase their influence on social media. In this context, choosing the right pose, lighting, and camera angle to get the best selfie of your life has become an important factor. However, getting the perfect combination of these elements requires specialized knowledge and skills, and hiring a photo studio and a professional photographer can be costly and difficult to schedule. Therefore, innovative methods are needed to fulfill this need. The goal of this research is to develop a photography studio automation system using robotic arms and AI to solve these problems. The robotic arm enables precise camera movement and angle adjustment, while the AI-based pose recommendation system can recommend optimal poses based on individual characteristics and situations. The system provides users with the convenience of taking the best selfie whenever they need it, which can make personal digital image creation easier and more effective. By using artificial intelligence technology to combine robot arm control, human recognition, understanding of user's personality, and recommendation of suitable poses and backgrounds, it presents a new paradigm for providing personalized photography services according to individual needs. This provides a means for each user to effectively express their own story, which will contribute to establishing a new way of personal expression in the digital age.
